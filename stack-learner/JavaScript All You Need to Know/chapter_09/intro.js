// What is functional programming programming

// Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”

// Three main terms

/**
 *  1. Pure functions
 *  2. First class functions
 *  3. Higher Order functions
 */


// function acts like a value
